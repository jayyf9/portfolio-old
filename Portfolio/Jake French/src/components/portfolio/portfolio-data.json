To create an in depth lighting device configuration solution allowing for configuration of device drivers and exporting a project file for programming the devices. Philips Lighting has a software solution available allowing users to configure lighting devices technical features, however, this is a feature rich and deep system and does not cater well to users without a lot of technical knowledge. MultiOne Web has the goal of providing Philips Lighting with a cloud-based replacement to their current software solution. With the aim of being a more fully fledged application providing wide configuration capabilities with a new improved flow and attractive user experience making the process more visual/interactive where possible.",
