Client Experience

-Meet/Plan
We will start by meeting and beginning discussions about what you are trying to achieve and the specifics of the website (pages/content/ideas).
-Design
Following our discussions I will get to work with different designs until I find my favourite options that meet your requirements. I will show and discuss these with you for feedback on any refinements that are needed.
-Develop
Development can begin, I will focus on writing clean organised code to bring the deign to life.
-Test
Testing is important as we want to provide a polished and stable final product, so rigourous testing on the website will be done before completion.
-Launch
Finally I will help get the website hosted in your chosen way and it will be ready to hit the web!


Rates/Availibility

All work is billed on a day rate basis and I usually book my available time in daily increments. A day is equal to 7 hours of work, which is also the minimum hours I usually book for depending on if we have worked together before or not. If your project requires a fixed price then this is also possible.

To check my current availibility please get in touch, this can change daily and I try to plan everything in advance. That being said please still contact me if your project requires urgent attention as we may be able to sort something out.




<h2>Portfolio</h2>
This portfolio give you an idea of what we do by showing some of our most recent work. 


Gaia Gemstone Jewelry
This website was developed for an independent jewelry maker who expertised in creating bespoke necklace, bracelets, earrings etc using only the best natural form gemstones. To reach a wider audience and demonstrate some of her products I set her up with a site that she could add her latest pieces and the material they are made from. As well as allowing people who wanted to discuss the possibilities of custom made pieces to contact her.

Eagle Structural
This website was for a local steel structural company looking to bring their business presence online. They wanted a way to show their past work and what they are capable of, as well as showing the accreditations for health and safety they have recieved for quality work.

Design Mine
A woodcarver and carpenter trying to take things nationwide came here to discuss how he can get the advertising and social media marketing that he needs without any computer knowledge. His main aim was to getting clients who need designs done through displaying his past work and encouraging them to get in touch. To do this he wanted a safe way of getting a line of communication with the potential customer so that he could discuss their ideas and take things further when ready.

Cycle Centre
Cycle centre is a local group that helps people less fortunate by working on old donated bikes by fixing them and giving them to people without. They wanted a way to show people what they were doing here as a way to increase the number of donations. They also regularly held events and wanted a way that they could let people know about upcoming events that they are holding. They wanted a design built for cycling enthusiasts that portrayed their passion but still showed that everyone is welcome to come and get involved.
